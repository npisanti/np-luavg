=====================================
sandbox for scripting vector graphics using lua binded to nanovg and some oF function, very opinionated workflow.

For Lua scripting i'm using [nanovg](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) binded with the help of [ofxLua](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxLua), that i just tweaked a bit. Some of the binded code also takes insperation from Satoru Higa's [ofxNanoVG](https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxNanoVG).
